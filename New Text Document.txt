IMMPORTANT COMMANDS IN SQL LANGGUAGE

1.to find out how many tables we have querry is

   "select table_name from user_tables;"

2.to find out ROWNUMBER

    " SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(Partition by ENAME ORDER BY ENAME) AS Row_Number from Emp;"

    " SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY ENAME) AS ROW_NUMBER FROM EMP;"

3. Using DISTINCT to Retrieve Non-Repeated Records
    
    "SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;

4.Retrieving Data Without NULL in a Certain Column

     "SELECT comm FROM emp WHERE comm IS NOT NULL;"

5.Filtering Data Using WHERE Clause

     " select empno,ename,job from emp where SAL='3000';

6. Filtering Data Using Conditions Joined by AND Operator
   Filtering Data Using Conditions Joined by OR Operator

     " select empno,ename,job from emp where sal='3000' or ename='ford';"
     " select empno,ename,job from emp where sal='3000' and ename='ford';"

7. Sorting Data According to One Column

     "select empno,ename from emp order by ename;"

8.Sorting Data According to More Than One Column

     "select empno,ename from emp order by ename desc, comm;"

9.13. Adding Data From Different Tables

      "select empno from emp union all select deptno from dept;"

      =>  expression must have same datatype as corresponding expression

10. Counting the Number of Rows in a Tablexd

      "select count(*) from emp;"
      "select count(comm) from emp where comm is not null;"

11.Finding the Intersection of Sets of Data

      "SELECT last_name FROM customer INTERSECT SELECT last_name FROM employee;

12.Joining Data From Different Tables
 
       "select *from s1 inner join s2 on s1.no=s2.no"
       "select *from s1 left join s2 on s1.no=s2.no"
       "select *from s1 right join s2 on s1.no=s2.no"
       "select *from s1 full join s2 on s1.no=s2.no"

13.subqueries: query within the other query is called subquery
     =>first will execute the inner query and then based on inner query results,
        outer query will be executed 

        "select *from emp where sal in(select min(sal) from emp);"

14.in line query = where ever we write the query from *
     =>first outer query will execute then based on outer query inner will execute
       and then based upon inner query results execution again outer query will be executed

       "select *from emp e1 where sal>(select min(sal) from emp e2 where e1.sal=e2.sal);"
       "select *from emp e1 where sal>=(select min(sal) from emp e2 where e1.sal=e2.sal);"
       "select *from emp where sal=(select max(sal) from emp);"

15.to insert decimal values are decimal(4,5) like this
    it means total no of intiger not more than 4 and right side digits are below 5

16. insert into input values(30,to_date('2021-12-12','yyyy-mm-dd'),to_date('2021-12-30','yyyy-mm-dd'));

17. select data,rank() over(order by data) as rank,dense_rank() over(order by data) as dense_rank,
     row_number() over(order by data) as row_number from data_culomn;                                             

DATA                  RANK DENSE_RANK ROW_NUMBER

18.insert nulls into table is
   INSERT INTO agents
   VALUES ("A001","Jodi","London",.12,NULL);

19.to view current date and timestamp;
   "SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP from dual;"
   "select current_date from dual;"

20.select avg(sal) from emp;
   select min(sal) from emp;
   select max(sal) from emp;
   select count(*) from emp;


21.alter table mk add name varchar(14);
   update mk set location='chilamkur' where no=1;


22.To find out duplicates

  A) SELECT COUNT(*),ID FROM DP_FIND GROUP BY ID;

  B)SELECT COUNT(*),ID FROM DP_FIND GROUP BY ID having count(*)=3;

  C)SELECT COUNT(*),ID FROM DP_FIND GROUP BY ID having count(*)>1;

23.multiple rows to single column

   " select listAgg(name, ',') within group(order by name) from table143;"
